				<div class="about-info">
					<p>Hi, I'm Kevin Mason and I'm a fourth year co-op student at the University of British Columbia majoring in both Business and Computer Science (BUCS). The BUCS program has been the perfect blend of my interests in both commerce and computer science. After four years in the program, my dream is to be one of the people that bridge the gap between the technical aspects of technology, and the strategic side of business.<br><br>
					Aside from academia and coding, I define myself as an athlete. For the past 13 years, I've been a competitive swimmer at WRASA, holding 3 club records and earning top ten placings of BCSSA's <a href="http://www.bcsummerswimming.com/boystop60.htm" target="_blank">Top 60 Swims of All Time</a>. During the past 5 years, I dedicated my time to giving back to the club through coaching. <br><br>
					During my final year, at the end of the 2014 season, I was inducted into the WRASA Hall of Fame. The award recognizes individuals who have made outstanding contributions to WRASA as both a swimmer and as a coach, resulting in the strengthening and advancement of WRASA. You can watch my induction video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30GpM1YURFE" target="_blank">here</a>.<br><br>
